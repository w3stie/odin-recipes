            <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>The Oklahoma Fried Onion Burger is one of the “oldest, classic burgers in the world,” according to Cailan. It was created in Oklahoma (obviously) during the Great Depression when meat was expensive but onions were cheap—so making smash burgers meant they could use less of the expensive meat and more of the cheap veggie.</p>

            <p>OG Oklahoma Fried Onion Burger was just meat, onion, and bun, but nowadays some burger joints add cheese, pickles, mustard, or other toppings.</p>
            

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon canola oil</li>
                <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>ounces freshly ground beef, divided into two 2 1/2-ounce balls</li>
                <li>2 slices American cheese</li>
                <li>1 medium onion, thinly sliced (about 1 cup sliced onions)</li>
                <li>Mustard, pickles, and other condiments, if desired</li>
                <li>2 soft hamburger buns</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Spread canola oil inside a large cast iron skillet with a paper towel. Heat over high heat until lightly smoking. Add balls of beef and press down with the back side of a spatula until completely flattened. Season generously with salt and pepper.</li>
                    <li>Carefully flip burgers with a stiff spatula, making sure to pick up all browned meat from skillet. Let cook until onions start to soften, about 1 minute. Add cheese and top with top bun. Place bottom bun upside-down over top bun to allow it to steam in the onion vapors.</li>
                    <li>Working quickly, spread onions evenly over cooking burgers and press down to embed onions into meat. Let cook with no further pressing until burgers are well browned, about 2 minutes.</li>
                    <li>When buns are soft, transfer bottom buns to a plate. Add condiments if desired. Lift up onions, burger, and top bun together and transfer to bottom bun. Repeat with second burger. Serve immediately.</li>
                </ol>
